I decided to try the Fried Salmon Hash and it did not disappoint. Salmon was cooked JUST right; not undercooked and not dry/over ooked. Prices are suitable for the portion and quality of food. Service can be a hit or miss depending on the day/time but nonetheless still a good spot in the DMV. You guys should definitely continue to expand! You will do great anywhere :)', '11/17/2018');
