# Terps-Foodies


## Introduction

This project is to create a system that will demonstrate the ranking of restaurants around University of Maryland and focus on helping people to find out restaurants they like. The system allows users to filter rankings by different types of foods within different price range. Ranking top restaurants based on crawling Yelp datasets.
